# GEMAct

GEMAct is a comprehensive **actuarial package**, based on the collective risk theory framework, that offers a set of tools for **non-life** (re)insurance **costing**, stochastic **claims reserving**, and **loss aggregation**.

The variety of available functionalities makes GEMAct modeling very flexible and provides actuarial scientists and practitioners with a powerful tool that fits into the expanding community of **Python** programming language.
